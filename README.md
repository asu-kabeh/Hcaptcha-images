# Images used in captcha
As title says, this repository literally contains the images used in hcaptcha. Each folder/directory specifies the type of images it contains. 
I would strictly suggest you to go through the images once, incase you found any which should not belong to the directory.

## Tool/Code used to scrap images:
1. [ Hcaptcha Scrapper ](https://github.com/Mewzax/Hcaptcha-Images-Scraper " Mewzax github")
2. Tool which helped alot in organizing pictures, finding similar ones, removing duplicate ones: [duplicate photo cleaner](https://www.duplicatephotocleaner.com/download "duplicate photo cleaner")
